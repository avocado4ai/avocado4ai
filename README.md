Hi there, I'm Yaron — @avocado4ai 👋

- 👀 I’m interested in AI-driven automation, system architecture, micro-SaaS products, hybrid RAG pipelines (Supabase + Qdrant), ESP32-based IoT, Docker-first DevOps, and generative music tech.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced LLM agent frameworks, production-grade n8n workflows, and real-time React/WebSocket.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects that blend AI, automation, and embedded devices—or anything that helps indie hackers ship faster.
- 📫 How to reach me: yaronel4.ai@gmail.com · LinkedIn · avocado4ai.com
- 😄 Pronouns: he / him
- ⚡ Fun fact: By night I DJ sunset techno sets as Digi Avocado; music and code helped me beat lung cancer and keep building cool stuff.
